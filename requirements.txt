# Note:
# Ensure that `libffi` is installed on your system, as it is required for compatibility with PyTorch.
# Installation instructions by operating system:
# 
# - **Ubuntu/Debian**: Run `sudo apt install libffi-dev`
# - **CentOS/RHEL**: Run `sudo yum install libffi-devel`
# - **macOS**: Install via Homebrew with `brew install libffi`
# - **Windows**: `libffi` is included in Windows Python distributions, so no extra installation is typically needed.
# 
# On WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), use the same command as for Linux distributions.
# If you encounter issues, check if `libffi.so.6` exists. If missing, create a symbolic link to the installed version:
# `sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6`
